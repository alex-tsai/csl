    <h4>Green Roof</h4>
    <div class="list">
      <div class="topic">
        <h4>Are powered by the sun</h4>
        <p>The solar panels facing Panther Hollow and on the roof of the adjacent building generate more electricity than the CSL uses.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic">
        <h4>Harvest their own water</h4>
        <p>The 3-acre site around you puts roughly 3.25 million gallons to use each year. The green alone captured nearly 90% of rainwater that fell on it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic">
        <h4>Are adapted to climate and site</h4>
        <p>As you can see from this vantage, the CSL building is long and narrow, which maximizes its southern exposure to take full advantage of the sun. This roof also insulates very well, keeping the building cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic">
        <h4>Operate pollution free</h4>
        <p>When necessary, the large white box on the green roof mechanically heats or cools the CSL. It uses energy recovery ventilation, geothermal and renewable energy rather than fossil fuel.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic">
        <h4>Are comprised of integrated systems</h4>
        <p>The weather station on the atrium roof is connected to the Building Automation System. This allows the building to react, like opening and closing windows, based on what is happening outside.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic">
        <h4>Promote health and well-being</h4>
        <p>Utilizing the roof as a garden creates a beautiful space to grow edible and medicinal plants and provides much needed habitat and food for pollinators.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic">
        <h4>Are beautiful</h4>
        <p>Looking out from the green roof, the view encompasses everything from iconic bridges to green spaces to row houses dotting steep hills. Each speaks to the diversity, history and dynamism that define Pittsburgh and the connections we all share with each other and the planet.</p>
