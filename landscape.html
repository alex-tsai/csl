  <h4>Landscape</h4>
  <div class="list">
    <div class="topic">
      <h4>Are powered by the sun</h4>
      <p>Projections extending from CSL windows on the inside and outside both block excess summer sun so it stays cool inside and reflect light into the interior, lighting the office area.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
      <h4>Harvest their own water</h4>
      <p>The porous soils, pervious surfaces and numerous raingardens of the site allow rainwater to soak into the ground and support plant life or recharge groundwater.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
      <h4>Are adapted to climate and site</h4>
      <p>Building on a site with such a steep cliff was a challenge but allowed the CSL to be nestled into hillside, which lowered heating and cooling costs. The terraced gardens feature several native plant communities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
      <h4>Operate pollution free</h4>
      <p>In addition to being combustion free, the CSL was built with as many salvaged and local materials as possible, reducing the carbon emissions associated with production and transport. For example, the pavers outside the door on the second level were made from old area roads.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
      <h4>Are comprised of integrated systems</h4>
      <p>The building and landscape are not separate entities but rather operate as one. For example, the concrete squares next to the boardwalk are the constructed wetland, which cleans building water for reuse.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
      <h4>Promote health and well-being</h4>
      <p>Once dilapidated and contaminated by leaking fuel tanks, this restored site is now home to one of the greenest building projects in the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
      <h4>Are beautiful</h4>
      <p>Seasons change, as does the CSL landscape. It was designed for four season interest, meaning its natural beauty is evident year round, whether through a riot of summertime color or through snow-heavy branches glistening in winter sun.</p>
