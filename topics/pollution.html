      <h2>Operate pollution free</h2>
      <p>Through photosynthesis, plants reduce atmospheric carbon levels. The combustion-free CSL contributes to better air quality.</p>
      
      <h4>Green Roof</h4>
      <p>When necessary, the large white box on the green roof mechanically heats or cools the CSL. It uses energy recovery ventilation, geothermal and renewable energy rather than fossil fuel.</p>
      
      <h4>Interior</h4>
      <p>On the bottom floor, a door with a window offers a view into the mechanical room. Here you can see the 14 geothermal lines that use the Earth’s relatively constant temperature to heat and cool the building.</p>

      <h4>Landscape</h4>
      <p>In addition to being combustion free, the CSL was built with as many salvaged and local materials as possible, reducing the carbon emissions associated with production and transport. For example, the pavers outside the door on the second level were made from old area roads.</p>
