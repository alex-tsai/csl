      <h2>Are beautiful</h2>
      <p>Upon encountering a flower, a botanist may see a specimen. A farmer may see future harvest. A child may see a plaything. But we all see — and are innately moved by — one thing: the flower’s beauty.The CSL strives to use the beauty of living in harmony with the natural world as inspiration for a brighter tomorrow.</p>
      
      <h4>Green Roof</h4>
      <p>Looking out from the green roof, the view encompasses everything from iconic bridges to green spaces to row houses dotting steep hills. Each speaks to the diversity, history and dynamism that define Pittsburgh and the connections we all share with each other and the planet.</p>
      
      <h4>Interior</h4>
      <p>Sculptures, paintings and other artworks throughout the building and landscape offer another level of sensory engagement and a new way to rekindle the innate bonds between people and nature.</p>

      <h4>Landscape</h4>
      <p>Seasons change, as does the CSL landscape. It was designed for four season interest, meaning its natural beauty is evident year round, whether through a riot of summertime color or through snow-heavy branches glistening in winter sun.</p>
