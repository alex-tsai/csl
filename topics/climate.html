      <h2>Are adapted to climate and site</h2>
      <p>Cacti and palm trees look different because they use different strategies to thrive in their specific habitats. The CSL was designed for this hilly spot in Pittsburgh.  A Living Building elsewhere would look different but could achieve the same success.</p>
      
      <h4>Green Roof</h4>
      <p>As you can see from this vantage, the CSL building is long and narrow, which maximizes its southern exposure to take full advantage of the sun. This roof also insulates very well, keeping the building cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.</p>
      
      <h4>Interior</h4>
      <p>Pittsburgh has both very hot and cold weather. On the top floor looking up, you can see wires across ceiling. The support shade cloths and energy blankets that can extend and keep the interior warmer or cooler depending on the season.</p>

      <h4>Landscape</h4>
      <p>Building on a site with such a steep cliff was a challenge but allowed the CSL to be nestled into hillside, which lowered heating and cooling costs. The terraced gardens feature several native plant communities.</p>
